# Compilation process
To compile the project you must first install the sfml libraries. To do this, just execute the following command:

                                    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
                                    
Then, execute the `Makefile` script, with the command `make` and it is going to build the object files inside the `obj` folder.

# Runnig the program
To execute the program you must execute the following command, been in the `shortest-path-in-cpp` folder after clonning the repository:


                                    ./shortest-path-in-cpp problem-file
                                    
`problem-file` is the file that specify the configuration of our problem.

## `Problem-file` configuration
The configuration of this file is as it follows:
* number for heuristic to use: [0 - 3]
* number of columns and rows of the problem:
* position of the car: 
* end position:
* number of obstacles:
*
