# Shortest Path In C++


## Overview
This project was made for an Artificial Intelligence subject. The goal was to get the best path from a starting point to an end point in a matrix, having obstacles in there. We decided to do it in C++ because is the only programming language that we had in common at the time, but we wanted to do something else than a console program, so we started to learn and use the [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php).
